# WesternQuadrantGame
An isometric shooter game I made with two fellow students as a class project for Game Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving II.

This game was created in C# using the MonoGame framework.

Included in the "Level Editor" folder is a level editor which can be used to create fully funtioning levels as txt files that may then be put in the game's "Levels" folder to be played.

Code can be found in the "CombinedCode" folder, and within that the folder labelled "Ryan Geyer Code" contains all code that I wrote myself.

The executable version can be found in "WesternQuadrant.zip"
